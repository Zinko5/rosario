## Overview

Victorian lithograph interface. Ideal for landing pages, saas. AI-ready template. Victorian typography never really left. It just went underground — into antique shops, flea market ephemera, the backrooms of print studios where letterpress operators kept their wood type blocks oiled and ready. Then around 2010, craft culture exploded. Breweries needed labels that looked like they'd survived a century in a cellar. Barbershops wanted signage that whispered "we existed before your grandfather." And suddenly, lithograph aesthetics weren't nostalgia — they were strategy.

The revival makes sense when you understand what these forms communicate. A hand-drawn vignette border doesn't just decorate; it says "someone sat here, for hours, with a nib." Ornamental ribbons carrying a brand name aren't decoration — they're a claim of lineage. The density of Victorian composition, those stacked serifs and interlocking frames, signals labor. And labor signals care. In a market drowning in Helvetica and flat minimalism, that density became a differentiator.

What's interesting is how the aesthetic has matured. Early revival work was pastiche — slap some distress textures on Playfair Display and call it artisan. The good work now understands proportion, ink spread, the way a real lithograph bleeds at the edges. It respects the craft it's referencing.
